# Text-to-speech
Problem: Software developers spend countless hours immersed in text-based environments, documentation, and troubleshooting messages. This constant exposure to text can lead to eye strain, fatigue, and decreased cognitive function, impacting their productivity and well-being. Switching can disrupt their thought process and workflow.

Current Solutions:

Manual text-to-speech tools: Often cumbersome, lack natural voices and require constant user interaction.
Audiobooks or podcasts: Not specific to code, distracting, and offer limited customization.



Desired Solution: 

A context-aware text-to-speech assistant seamlessly integrated into the developer's environment that:

Real-time narration: Reads code, documentation, and error messages aloud in a natural-sounding voice.

Customization: Allows adjusting speech speed, pitch, and highlighting specific code sections.

Offline functionality: Works without an internet connection, protecting sensitive code.

Integration with existing tools: Integrates with code editors, IDEs, and debugging tools for a smooth workflow.

Multilingual support: Supports various programming languages and spoken languages.
